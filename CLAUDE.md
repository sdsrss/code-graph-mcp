# code-graph-mcp

## Project Overview

Rust MCP server that indexes codebases into an AST knowledge graph with semantic search. Communicates via JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Rust 2021 edition
- **Parser**: Tree-sitter (10 languages: TS, JS, Go, Python, Rust, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS)
- **Storage**: SQLite (rusqlite with bundled-full) + FTS5 + sqlite-vec (bundled C extension via build.rs)
- **Embedding**: Candle (optional, feature-gated `embed-model`)
- **File watching**: notify crate
- **Hashing**: blake3 for Merkle tree change detection

## Module Layout

```
src/
├── domain.rs     # Shared constants (relation types, limits, dimensions) — canonical source
├── mcp/          # JSON-RPC protocol, tool registry, server (stdio entry point)
├── parser/       # Tree-sitter AST parsing, relation extraction, language dispatch
├── indexer/      # 3-phase pipeline (parse → extract → embed), Merkle tree, file watcher
├── storage/      # SQLite schema init, CRUD operations, parameterized queries
├── graph/        # Recursive CTE call graph queries (callers/callees)
├── search/       # RRF fusion (BM25 + vector similarity)
├── embedding/    # EmbeddingModel struct, context builder
├── sandbox/      # Context compressor with token estimation
└── utils/        # Language detection from file extension, config
```

## Key Commands

```bash
cargo check                        # Type check
cargo build --release              # Full build with embedding
cargo build --no-default-features  # Build without embedding model
cargo test                         # Run all tests
cargo test --no-default-features   # Tests without embedding
```

## Important Patterns

- **Feature gating**: `embed-model` feature controls Candle dependencies; code using embeddings must be behind `#[cfg(feature = "embed-model")]`
- **Database**: SQLite with sqlite-vec compiled from `vendor/sqlite-vec/sqlite-vec.c` via `build.rs`
- **Relation constants**: Defined in `src/domain.rs` (re-exported from `storage/schema.rs`) — use constants (e.g., `REL_CALLS`) instead of hardcoded strings
- **Schema**: Defined in `src/storage/schema.rs` — parameterized queries in `src/storage/queries.rs`
- **MCP tools**: Registered in `src/mcp/tools.rs`, handled in `src/mcp/server.rs`
- **Data directory**: `.code-graph/` under project root, auto-created and gitignored

## Conventions

- Commit format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` (e.g., `feat(parser): add relation extraction`)
- Error handling: `anyhow::Result` throughout, tracing for logging to stderr
- Tests: Unit tests in modules, integration tests in `tests/integration.rs`

## Code Graph — Efficient Code Navigation

This project has a code-graph MCP server providing AST-level code intelligence.
These tools return structured, token-efficient results. Use them as your
PRIMARY navigation method for code understanding tasks.

| You want to... | Use this | NOT this |
|---|---|---|
| Find code by concept/meaning | `semantic_code_search` | Grep multiple patterns |
| Understand who calls what | `get_call_graph` | Grep function name + Read files |
| Trace HTTP request flow | `trace_http_chain` | Read router -> handler -> service |
| Find route handler | `find_http_route` | Grep route string |
| Get symbol signature + relations | `get_ast_node` | Read entire file |
| Read specific code after search | `read_snippet` (by node_id) | Read entire file |

**Still use native tools for:** exact string match (Grep), file path lookup (Glob),
reading a specific known file (Read).
